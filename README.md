This is my coverpage. Things to notice beside the obvious code in index.html.erb, and _header file. i did a rails generate scaffold post, hints why
-you see the post controler ect. 
Reasoning, because i wanted it to display 6 cards at the bottom where my table is with my projects. With a button that says next page, then it would display
another 6 cards. Couldnt figure it out so i made a table with buttons that say simple projects and not simple. 
I also made an about page. just in case i want to do something with it.
